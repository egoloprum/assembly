## Assembly Language Learning Repository
This repository contains a collection of assembly language codes that I developed during my learning journey at BMSTU. These codes cover various concepts, instructions, and programming techniques related to assembly language programming.

These codes are shared for educational purposes, and they may not represent optimal or production-level code. Always refer to official documentation and best practices when working on real-world projects.
